# Alps iOS SDK

`AlpsSDK` is a contextualized publish/subscribe model which can be used to model any geolocated or proximity based mobile application. Save time and make development easier by using our SDK. We are built on Apple Core Location technologies and we also provide iBeacons compatibility.

## Versioning

SDK is written using Swift 4.

Alps SDK requires iOS 10+.

## Installation

Alps is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), simply add the following
line to your Podfile:

    pod 'AlpsSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/MatchMore/alps-ios-sdk.git'

### Set up APNS: Certificates for push notifications

Alps iOS SDK uses Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) to deliver notifications to your iOS users.

If you already know how to enable APNS, don't forget to upload the certificate in our portal.

Also, you need to add the following lines to your project `AppDelegate`.

These callbacks allow the SDK to get the device token.

```swift
// Called when APNS has assigned the device a unique token
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    // Convert token to string
    let deviceTokenString = deviceToken.reduce("", {$0 + String(format: "%02X", $1)})
    MatchMore.registerDeviceToken(deviceToken: deviceTokenString)
}

// Called when APNS failed to register the device for push notifications
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]) {
    MatchMore.processPushNotification(pushNotification: userInfo)
}
```

Else, you can find help on [how to setup APNS](https://github.com/matchmore/alps-ios-sdk/blob/master/ApnsSetup.md).

## Technical overview

The `MatchMore` is a static wrapper that provides you all the functions you need to use our SDK.

Features of MatchMore iOS SDK is divided into two parts: Asynchronous calls and dynamic calls.

### Asynchronous calls

All the asynchronous functions calls our cloud service and return a completion for you.

### Dynamic calls

Everytime you call an asynchronous function and it succeeds, our SDK stores it. To gain speed, we allow you to get access(read only) to these stored values.

## Usage

Please refer to documentation "tutorial" to get a full explanation on this example:

Setup application API key and world, get it for free from [http://matchmore.io/](http://matchmore.io/).
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    MatchMore.apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    MatchMore.worldId = "YOUR_WORLD_ID"
    return true
}
```

Create first device, publication and subscription. Please note that we're not caring about errors right now.
```swift
MatchMore.startUsingMainDevice { _ in
    let publication = Publication(topic: "Test Topic", range: 20, duration: 100, properties: ["test": "true"])
    MatchMore.createPublication(publication: publication, completion: { _ in
        print("üèî Created Pub")
    })                    
    let subscription = Subscription(topic: "Test Topic", range: 20, duration: 100, selector: "test = 'true'")
    MatchMore.createSubscription(subscription: subscription, completion: { _ in
        print("üèî Created Sub")
    })
}
```

Define an object that's `AlpsManagerDelegate` implementing `OnMatchClojure`.
```swift
class MatchWatcher: AlpsManagerDelegate {
    var onMatch: OnMatchClojure?
    init(_ onMatch: @escaping OnMatchClojure) {
        self.onMatch = onMatch
    }
}
```

Start listening for main device matches changes.
```swift
let matchWatcher = MatchWatcher { matches, _ in print(matches) }
MatchMore.delegates += matchWatcher
```
